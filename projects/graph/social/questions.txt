1. To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, 
how many times would you need to call addFriendship()? Why?

The number of times to call addFriendship() would be 500 = (100 * 10) / 2.
To have an average of 10 friends for each user, there would need to be 1,000 total friends across all users.
The addFriendship() method creates 2 friends every call, so 1,000 / 2 = 500 total calls.

2. If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, 
what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended social network? 
What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network?
